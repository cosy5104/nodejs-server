# **Node js web server**
This is a basic HTTP Server using Node. It covers HTTP Request object that will be received by the server. We use String Decoder to parse the string to the server. We tested the HTTP request methods using postman. When a new request is send(using GET Request), a response is received and a message to the browser. This applies to POST request also. Any form of data can be parsed to the server.
